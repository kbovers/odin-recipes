# odin-recipes
For this project i have to set up a website with 3 different recipes.
From this porject i hope to show my bassic understanding of HTML basics. 
I found this project enjoyable! I feel that my skills have improved from doing this project.
I am happy with the outcome, of course there are is room for improvement and the website looks basic but i can always add to it in the future.
